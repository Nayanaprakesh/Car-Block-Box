# Car-Block-Box
Designing a car block box with a PIC microcontroller involves utilizing MPLAB IDE and XC8 compiler. The system records events such as gear shifts, logs data, and allows functions like viewing logs, changing passwords, and resetting time. PIC microcontroller interfaces with sensors to detect gear shifts, storing data in non-volatile memory.
